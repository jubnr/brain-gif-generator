# 🧠 Brain GIF Generator

A **fast and user-friendly local web application** built with Streamlit and MNE-Python to generate high-quality, customizable animated GIFs of brain activity from MNE source estimate (`.stc`) files.

This tool is designed to be run on your own computer, giving you full control over your data and the generation process without needing to upload anything to the internet.

## 🚀 Features

*   📂 **Local File Upload**: Works with `.stc` or `.stc.h5` files from your computer.
*   🖼️ **Transparent Background**: Toggle for a transparent background, ideal for overlays (work in progress!).
*   🎨 **Colormap Selection**: Choose from a wide range of colormaps (e.g., `hot`, `viridis`, `coolwarm`).
*   ⚫️ **Background Color**: Set the background to `white` or `black`.
*   🌈 **Colorbar Toggle**: Show or hide the colorbar.
*   🧠 **Cortex Style**: Select from different cortex rendering styles (`low_contrast`, `classic`, `high_contrast`).
*   ↔️ **Hemisphere Views**: Visualize the left (`lh`), right (`rh`), or both hemispheres in a `split` view.
*   👀 **Multiple Camera Angles**: Select and combine multiple views (`lateral`, `medial`, `rostral`, etc.).
*   〰️ **Data Smoothing**: Apply smoothing to the surface data for a cleaner look.
*   🎬 **Animation Control**: Adjust the frame step and duration to fine-tune your GIF.
*   ✅ **Instant Preview**: The generated GIF is displayed directly in the app.
*   ⬇️ **Direct Download**: Download your generated GIF with a single click.

## 📦 Local Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get the Brain GIF Generator running on your local machine.

#### **1. Prerequisites**
*   **Python 3.8+**
*   An environment management tool like `venv` or `conda` is highly recommended.

#### **2. Installation & Running the App**

Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository (or download the code)
git clone https://github.com/jubnr/brain-gif-generator.git
cd brain-gif-generator

# 2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv # optional

# 3. Install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Run the Streamlit app
streamlit run app.py
```
After running the last command, your default web browser should automatically open a new tab with the running application.

## ⚙️ How to Use the App Interface

Once the app is running in your browser, the process is simple:

1.  **Upload File**: In the sidebar, click "Browse files" and select an `.stc` or `.stc.h5` file.
2.  **Customize**: Adjust the settings in the "Display Customization" and "Animation Settings" sections to your preference.
3.  **Generate**: Click the primary "Generate GIF" button. The app will show progress indicators while it works.
4.  **Preview & Download**: Once complete, your GIF will appear on the main page. Use the "Download GIF" button to save it.

## 💡 How It Works
The application follows a simple pipeline:

1.  **Upload & Configure**: The user uploads an `.stc` file and selects visualization parameters from the sidebar.
2.  **MNE Visualization**: MNE-Python's 3D plotting backend (`pyvista`) is used to create a `Brain` object on the `fsaverage` template. The MNE `fsaverage` dataset is automatically downloaded and cached on first run.

3.  **Frame Generation**: The app iterates through the specified time points of the source estimate, saving a high-resolution PNG screenshot for each frame into a temporary directory.
4.  **GIF Assembly**: The `imageio` library compiles the individual PNG frames into a single, optimized, looping GIF, and will correctly handling transparency (work still in progress!).
5.  **Display & Download**: The final GIF is presented to the user for preview and download.

## 🤝 Contributing & Future Ideas

Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open an issue and/or submit a pull request.

Some potential ideas for future development:
*   Allowing users to select a custom time range for the animation.
*   Adding more advanced `mne.viz.Brain` parameters as options.
*   Support for other template brains besides `fsaverage` (e.g. brain anatomy of a specific subject).
